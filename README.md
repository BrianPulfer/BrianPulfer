## Hey! 👋

Thanks for coming by. My name is Brian Pulfer and I am currently a Ph.D student in Machine Learning at the University of Geneva, Switzerland 🇨🇭.

I am fascinated by the elegance and power of Machine Learning and I am currently learning as much as possible to maximize my positive impact on humanity.
